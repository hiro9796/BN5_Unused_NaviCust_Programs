# BN5_Unused_NaviCust_Programs
This mod allows you to get the unreleased Navi Cust Programs. Allowing you to farm tier 2 and tier 3 virus related chips that are otherwise can only be farmed after clearing the story.


Feature:
1. Provide the following Navi Cust Programs:
  a. Mega Virus (AABLARBLAA) - Allows MegaMan to encounter Tier 2 Viruses without needing to open the portal to Nebula Area 1. Cannot be removed in Cyberworld upon equipped
  b. Giga Virus (BBRALBLARR) - Allows MegaMan to encounter Tier 3 Viruses without needing to open the portal to Nebula Area 4. Cannot be removed in Cyberworld upon equipped.
  c. Hub Batch  (ALRABLRALR) - Gives Super Armor, Air Shoes, Float Shoes, Custom 1, Mega Folder 1, Shield, and Under Shirt. Does not actually compress the program by one block but the confirmation noise can be heard upon input.
2. Mega Virus and Giga Virus is provided when paying 1000 zennies for MineKey. Fitting since you only just received Navi Customizer a while before meeting him.
3. Hub Batch is obtained when defeating Chaos Lord (Dark MegaMan). Do not skip cutscene upon victory or it won't be added to your inventory.
4. Mega Virus and Giga Virus DOES NOT CHANGE THE CONTENT OF MYSTERY DATA in the internet. That one you have to talk to Gold Prog at Undernet 2 alternate entrance and entrance to Nebula Area 4 respectively.
